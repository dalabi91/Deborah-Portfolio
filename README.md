Welcome to my developer portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects completed througout edX web development bootcamp programe to future employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time  position. In  this project i have applied knewly learnt core skill such as grid, flex-box and media queries.



## Project Goals

The primary goal for this project  is to have a portfolio that satifies a typical hiring manager's needs. To achieve this, CSS and HTML language were used ensuring all acceptance criteria are covered/met.

### Acceptance Criteria

    1. When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo/avatar, and links to sections about you, my work, and how to contact me

    2. When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

    3. When viewing the section about my work, the section contains titled images of my applications

    4. When presented with my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

    5. When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

    6. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to viewport

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Before starting this project, i made sure i familirise myself with the acceptance criteria and understood the requirement.

I also made sure all teh asset were in the correct folder. Also made sure that all images are in png and those that are not were converted. The reason for this is because PNG files benefit from lossless compression, meaning that no data is lost when the images are compressed. This makes it easier and smoother to work with image.
